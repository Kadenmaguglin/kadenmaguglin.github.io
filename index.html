        >Welcome to my online portfolio!
        Here you'll find all the web development work I've done aswell as some of my favorite artworks! You can find all that stuff by
        clicking the "Portfolio" tab on the top right, and you can conttact me at any time by clicking
        the "Contact" tab right next to it! <br><br>But why would you want to DO that? Who AM I??<br><br>Well I'll tell ya! My name is Kaden Maguglin, I'm 20 years old from Simi Valley! 
        I've attended Moorpark College for a couple years now since the end of high school and
         I'm currerntly enrolled in the UCLA bootcamp for full stack web development. I found myself interested in 
         this program because I think that express education and a university certification would help my career out 
         immensly as compared to slogging all the way through the entire college process. I still plan 
         on attending Moorpark, but hopefully after this program is through I'll be able to focus on 
         the classes I WANT to take rather than the ones I HAVE to take! My goal is to make enough money to
         get by comfortably while continuing to pursue mastery over my favorite hobbies.

        As for my personal life, I'm a big brother to four little siblings, Dani Amaya Emily and Vincent. They are my babies and I do 
        everything for them. I'm super proud of them. I am always trying to better myself for their sake, to make sure that they have a good role model to look up to.
         <br>Aside from loving my family, I love to go mountain biking, I love to cook, and I'm a pretty big Gamerâ„¢<br><br>
